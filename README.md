# PeteBot
Code for a Morse code speaking robot, based on NXP's LPC810 microcontroller.
Morse code is implemented on the LPC810

I made a robot out of brass for my uncle who was dying of cancer with a message for him in Morse code.
(I gave him  a Morse code cheet sheet too, with the message written down!)

It also had an external LCD display which plugged into PeteBot to display the uart message and that was driven by an arduino pro mini.

I miss him, but he loved it.
